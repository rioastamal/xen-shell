xen-shell
---------

  This package contains a simple script called 'xen-shell' which is
 designed to be a login shell for a user on a Xen host.

  There are several commands available within this shell which will
 allow the user to control their Xen guest instance.

  The shell allows:

  * Shutdown.
  * Bootup.
  * Reboot.
  * Console access.

  This shell supports integrated help, along with command history,
 and command completion.


Notes
-----

  We have to do some special magic for the console access since to  
 run the Xen console you need to execute, as root, "xm console id".

  We setup the shell environment of GNU Screen to be a simple script
 because screen only allows a single binary to be setup as the shell,
 not the full "xm console ..." command and arguments.

  GNU Screen has several abilities to "break out", I've disabled all
 the ones I can spot.  There may be holes.


Installation
------------

  sudo make install

  Once installed set each user who you wish to control a Xen instance
 to have their shell as /usr/local/bin/xen-shell.

  You'll need to ensure that these users can run "xm" as root with
 no password, via sudo:


# /etc/sudoers
---
User_Alias   XENUSERS = steve,nsa,grimoire,joey
Cmnd_Alias   XEN      = /usr/sbin/xm
XENUSERS     ALL      = NOPASSWD: XEN

  Surely some mistake, Mr Bond?
