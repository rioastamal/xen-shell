Reporting Bugs
--------------

  To report a bug please use the xen-tools mailing list:

        http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-shell/lists.html

  If you're capable of fixing it yourself a patch is appreciated,
 and a test case would be a useful bonus.


Known Bugs
----------

  The Debian bug tracker might contains a list of all currently
 open issues with the software:

        http://bugs.debian.org/xen-shell

  If you're running the code on a Debian host system then reporting 
 bugs against the Debian package is a good thing to do; by doing so
 you allow others to view issues, and I check the bug-page regularly.
